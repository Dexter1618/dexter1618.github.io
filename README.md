# Website content for my portfolio/blog

Hi.

This is where I store, add and update content for my Github website.

## 1 Website Design Template

Strata by HTML5 UP

A simple, minimalist template that actually began life as an unused redesign of my
personal site. Includes a (configurable) parallax background effect, Poptrox-powered
lightbox gallery, a bunch of pre-styled elements, and Sass sources for the Sass-inclined.

PS: Not sure how to get that contact form working? Give formspree.io a try (it's awesome).

- Icons used: [Font Awesome](fontawesome.io)
- Other resources used: [jQuery](jquery.com) AND [Responsive Tools](github.com/ajlkn/responsive-tools)

## 3 Image Formatting

I used [this](https://pinetools.com/darken-image) online tool from `PineTools` to help edit the images used in my website
